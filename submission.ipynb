    "\"Recently, I wrote a program to find all sets of primes summing to a given number. I found the project to be extremely interesting and challenging. I have always been fascinated by math and numbers. The opportunity to dive deeper into prime numbers and discover new ways to add them up was a true thrill for me. Not only did this project allow me to enhance my programming skills, but it also allowed me to exercise my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I enjoyed the process of brainstorming and testing different algorithms to find the most efficient solution. Overall, I believe that this project has greatly contributed to my development as a student and I am excited to continue exploring the world of math and programming in the future.\" \n",

    "Let me explain. A bit ago, I did the project mentioned above. I decided to write about it for this application, and about the process of creating the code (which I will explain in detail below), but realized I was supposed to write about *why* I found it interesting, not how I made it. I couldn't think of anything to write, though, and had the idea to use ChatGPT. I figure there is no better way to demonstrate my interest in AI, math and programming than by manipulating AI to help with this application! \n",

    "> One of my goals with this project was to create something that was **efficient** and **fast**. For example, in my original code, my primesUpToN function includes a lookup table to speed up calls for numbers under 20,000. For the sake of brevity, I have not included the full lookup table in this document, but the unabridged code is in separate files. Additionally, the function decorator `@lru_cache(maxsize=None)` appears often. It wraps and memoizes the function it decorates, creating a cache, a lookup table, in order to quickly run functions if they are called with the same parameters many times. The `maxsize=None` disables the limit on the size of the lookup table. The decorator is part of the standard library module _functools_.\n"
